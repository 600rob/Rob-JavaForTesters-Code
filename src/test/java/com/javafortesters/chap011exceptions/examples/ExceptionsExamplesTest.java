general notes:
-Code in the try block will always run.
-The catch block will execute only if the declared exception is thrown.
-Exceptions that are thrown in the catch block will propagate up the stack i.e. to calling methods.
-Exceptions will ONLY be caught If they are of the type declared in the catch block
-If a different exception is thrown then it will NOT be caught ONLY NullPointerException will be caught
in this instance because thats what i specified
-If an exception is thrown within the catch block
then it wonâ€™t be re-caught again because there is no try catch statement surrounding it.
