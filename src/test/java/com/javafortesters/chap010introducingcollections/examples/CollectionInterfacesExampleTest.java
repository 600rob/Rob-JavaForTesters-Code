In the above code we have a usable variable called workdays.
But a collection can contain any object, and since we didnâ€™t
specify what the collection will contain it defaults to object.
This will become an annoyance later when we try and iterate through the
 collection and have to cast the elements from object to String.
 As a recommendation, when you work with a collection, and the objects to be
 stored in the collection are all of the same type then declare the
 collection as a collection of type e.g.
